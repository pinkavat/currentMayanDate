## Installation

Download [currentMayanDate.c](currentMayanDate.c) and compile it with any C compiler.
There are no dependencies beyond the standard libraries.

## Usage

Running the resulting executable will compute Mayan Calendar information for the 
current date and print it to `stdout`, formatted thus:

```
===== [Long Count] <Tzolk'in><Haab'> <Lord of the Night> =====
<Modern Yucatec prophecy associated with the Tzolk'in day>
```

for example:

```
===== [13.0.7.4.11] 2 Chuwen 19 Pax G1 =====
It is The Day of The Artist: Favorable to augment all things.
```
